# CS5131 Project

This duo project intends to provide an alternative to the fingerprint scanners at our boarding school using facial recognition. The project only intends to cover the backend, and there will be no prototype. Hardware used for demostration will be camera from computer.

How I intend to do this is:
we take turns working on the project and comitting to github. We should run the files locally on the kaggle site since they allow you to use their free GPUs and then we upload the output here. Because of that, we will need to download and upload the training weights.

To get the training data:
