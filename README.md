# CS5131 Project

How I intend to do this is:
we take turns working on the project and comitting to github. We should run the files locally on the kaggle site since they allow you to use their free GPUs and then we upload the output here. Because of that, we will need to download and upload the training weights.

- Copy format from individual assignment
- Implement CNN

We are forgoing the actual prototype part and will instead be using my laptop camera
