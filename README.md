# CS5131 Project

This duo project intends to provide an alternative to the fingerprint scanners at our boarding school using facial recognition. The project only intends to cover the backend, and there will be no prototype. Hardware used for demonstration will be camera from computer.

At the end of the project we should have chosen either of the models for the facial recognition. The way we input the training data is somehow make code to:
1. Take a video at 15-30fps
2. Split the video into its individual frames
3. Move all of said frames into a folder
